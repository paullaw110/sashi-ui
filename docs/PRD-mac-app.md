# PRD: Sashi UI Mac App

**Status:** 🟡 Phase 3 Foundation Complete (2026-01-31)

## Overview

Transform Sashi UI from a web application into a native macOS application, providing a faster, more integrated desktop experience with native OS features.

---

## Goals

1. **Native feel** — Feels like a first-class Mac citizen, not a wrapped website
2. **Performance** — Instant startup, no browser overhead
3. **Offline support** — Works without internet (syncs when connected)
4. **System integration** — Menu bar, notifications, keyboard shortcuts, Spotlight
5. **Always available** — Quick access from menu bar or global hotkey

---

## User Stories

### Core
- As a user, I want to launch Sashi instantly from my dock or menu bar
- As a user, I want to use Cmd+K to open quick add from anywhere on my Mac
- As a user, I want to see task notifications even when the app is in the background
- As a user, I want my tasks to sync automatically when I come back online

### Power User
- As a user, I want to use native keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+N, Cmd+,, etc.)
- As a user, I want the app to remember my window position and size
- As a user, I want to search tasks via Spotlight
- As a user, I want to right-click items for context menus

## Technical Approach Options

### Option A: Tauri (Recommended)
**What:** Lightweight framework using system WebView + Rust backend

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| ~10MB app size (vs 150MB+ Electron) | Newer ecosystem |
| Uses native WebKit (Safari engine) | Less community resources |
| Fast startup, low memory | Learning Rust for native features |
| Can reuse 95% of React code | |
| Native menu bar, notifications | |

**Effort:** 2-3 weeks for MVP

### Option B: Electron
**What:** Chromium + Node.js wrapped in app bundle

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Mature ecosystem | 150MB+ app size |
| Easy to develop | High memory usage |
| Huge community | Feels like a browser |
| Same as VS Code, Slack, Discord | Slower startup |

**Effort:** 1-2 weeks for MVP

### Option C: Native Swift
**What:** True native macOS app with SwiftUI

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Best performance | Complete rewrite |
| Smallest app size | Can't reuse React code |
| True native UX | Mac-only (no Windows later) |
| Best OS integration | Longest development time |

**Effort:** 8-12 weeks for feature parity

### Option D: PWA (Progressive Web App)
**What:** Web app installed as standalone app

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Zero additional code | Limited native features |
| Auto-updates | No menu bar presence |
| Works today | No global shortcuts |
| Smallest effort | Browser-dependent |

**Effort:** 1 day (already mostly works)

---

## Recommendation: Tauri

Tauri provides the best balance of:
- **Native experience** without rewriting in Swift
- **Small footprint** (~10MB vs 150MB Electron)
- **Code reuse** — Our React app works directly
- **Future-proof** — Can add Windows/Linux later

## Open Questions

1. **Pricing?** — Free, one-time purchase, or subscription?
2. **Web + Mac sync?** — Use same Turso DB or separate?
3. **Windows version?** — Plan for cross-platform now?
4. **Beta program?** — How to recruit testers?

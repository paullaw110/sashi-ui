# 2026-01-29 - imPAC Product Development Session

## Context
Paul introduced me to the #impac-product channel for building out the imPAC Labs product (cloud security startup where he's Product Designer).

## Key Developments

### Feature Development Workflow
- **Established CAST: command structure** - Paul liked "option A" for skill invocation
- **Created comprehensive process**: `/Users/sashi/clawd/FEATURE-DEVELOPMENT-PROCESS.md`
- **Command syntax**: `CAST: SKILL_NAME` followed by context (BG3 spell-casting vibe)

**Core workflow:**
1. `CAST: CREATE_PRD` ⚡ - Generate PRD with test scenarios
2. `CAST: GENERATE_TASKS` 🎯 - Break down into actionable tasks  
3. `CAST: SETUP_BRANCH` 🌿 - Git workflow + draft PR automation
4. `CAST: GENERATE_TESTS` 🧪 - Playwright tests from acceptance criteria
5. `CAST: IMPLEMENT_FEATURE` ⚔️ - Parallel coding agent orchestration  
6. `CAST: VALIDATE_DEPLOY` 🛡️ - Quality gates + production deploy

### imPAC Tech Stack Analysis
- **Repository**: `paullaw110/impaclabs` (React + TypeScript + Vite)
- **Sophisticated design system**: 301 Zeplin design tokens with semantic mapping
- **Enterprise-grade Tailwind config** with dark/light mode support
- **Assessment**: 85% perfect for high-fidelity prototyping

**Recommendation**: Don't rebuild - enhance existing stack:
- Add Framer Motion for micro-interactions
- Add Storybook for component showcase
- Weekend implementation plan provided

### Storybook Implementation Plan
- **Goal**: Weekend implementation over existing codebase
- **Focus**: Document existing UI components (`src/components/ui/`)
- **Deploy**: Chromatic or GitHub Pages for stakeholder demos

## Technical Insights
- imPAC has better design system than most production apps
- Component architecture is well-structured (compound components)
- React Query already integrated for data management
- TypeScript ensures type safety throughout

## Next Actions
- Paul may request CAST: CREATE_PRD for Storybook implementation
- Ready to build the 4 new workflow skills when needed
- Tech stack enhancement recommendations ready for implementation

## Paul's Work Style
- Values weekend-implementable solutions
- Appreciates direct, no-fluff communication
- Prefers enhancing existing work over rebuilds
- Design systems thinking applied to everything

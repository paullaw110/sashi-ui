## Tailscale Installation Issues
- Paul tried to install Tailscale via `brew install tailscale && sudo tailscale up`
- Installation succeeded but `tailscale up` failed - daemon not responding
- Brew service started successfully but the daemon couldn't be reached
- Issue left unresolved, moved on to other tasks

## Context Compaction Configuration
- Paul experiencing context overflow errors in #general channel (171K+ tokens)
- Modified config to enable more aggressive automatic context compaction:
  - Changed compaction mode from "safeguard" to "default"
  - Enabled memory flush at 120K tokens (soft threshold)
  - Set reserve tokens floor to 40K
  - Gateway restarted successfully
- Should prevent future context overflow errors

## Channel Behavior
- Paul noted I'm being selective about responding in #general channel
- Confirmed this is intentional per AGENTS.md guidelines - only respond when:
  - Directly mentioned
  - Can add genuine value
  - Specific question needs answering
  - Something needs correcting

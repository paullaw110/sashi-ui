## imPAC Website Rebuild (Paul)

### Project Context
- **Repo:** github.com/paullaw110/impac-web
- **Stack:** Astro + Tailwind
- **Goal:** Rebuild Webflow site in code so I can make future edits
- **Live site:** impac.io (Webflow - reference for content)

### Work Completed Today

**Product Pages Created:**
- `/product/playbooks` (existed, updated images)
- `/product/compose` (created + images)
- `/product/vault` (created + images)
- `/product/time-machine` (created, images pending)

**Other Pages Created/Fixed:**
- `/why-impac` (The imPAC Difference page)
- `/solutions/prevent-cloud-breaches`
- `/solutions/extend-data-controls`
- All 9 blog posts in `/blogs/`
- Company page copy updated to match live
- Platform page headline fixed
- Library page headline fixed

**Styling Applied:**
- Hero sections: graph background image with gradient overlay
- Feature sections: dot pattern + gradient (#06131A → #0D1921 → #06131A)

**Forms:**
- Switched to Basin forms (placeholder IDs)
- Need Paul to provide actual Basin form ID to replace `YOUR_BASIN_FORM_ID`

### Still Pending
- Time Machine product page images
- Replace Basin form placeholder IDs

### Tools Setup
- TinyPNG CLI installed with Paul's API key (alias in ~/.zshrc)
- Decided to skip TinyPNG for most images - Astro handles optimization at build time

### Image Workflow
- Paul uploads to Slack
- I save to `src/assets/images/products/[product]/`
- Astro compresses at build time (converts to WebP)

### Total Pages: 30

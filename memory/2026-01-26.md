# 2026-01-26 - SuperLandings Lead Pipeline Launch

## Major Milestone: Built Complete Leads Feature for SuperLandings

Paul shared comprehensive SuperLandings knowledge transfer, then I built the entire lead generation system:

### What I Built
- **Database schema**: Added `leads` table to sashi-ui with all qualification fields
- **UI Components**: LeadsTable, LeadSidePanel, LeadsView with filtering/sorting
- **API Routes**: GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE `/api/leads` + scrape endpoint
- **Navigation**: Added "Leads" tab to sidebar (Target icon)
- **Scrape script**: Node.js script using Outscraper API + qualification scoring

### Technical Details
- **Outscraper API key**: Stored securely, tested successfully
- **Pipeline**: Outscraper → qualification scoring → SQLite → UI
- **Scoring logic**: No website = 100pts, good reviews + bad site = high score
- **First test**: 10 dentists from Riverside, CA - successfully scraped and inserted

### SuperLandings Business Model (Key Facts)
- **Service**: Subscription web design for local businesses ($59-99/mo)
- **Tech Stack**: Astro + Tailwind + Cloudflare Pages + Formspree
- **Target**: 50-60 clients year one, 1-5 new clients/month
- **Lead Gen Goal**: 50-100 leads scraped weekly → 5 qualified leads → manual outreach
- **8-Phase Design Workflow**: Strategic work before code (research → copy → design → build)

### Paul's Current Thinking
- **Reality check needed**: Cold outreach with spec sites is time-intensive (1-2 hrs/site for 2-5% response rate)
- **Wants alternatives**: Asked for other lead gen options beyond cold outreach
- **My recommendation**: Start with audit-first emails, only build specs for warm responses

### Lead Gen Options I Suggested
- **Tier 1**: Google Business Profile, referrals, partnerships
- **Tier 2**: X/Twitter content, LinkedIn outreach, YouTube teardowns  
- **Tier 3**: Cold email (audit-first), door-to-door local
- **Tier 4**: Paid ads, lead marketplaces

### Next Steps
- Paul needs to decide on lead gen approach
- Could set up weekly cron for auto-scraping
- Could wire up "Run Scrape" button in UI
- PageSpeed API integration pending (need Google Cloud API key)

## Status: Lead pipeline is live and functional. Paul can start qualifying and reaching out to the 10 dentist prospects already in the system.

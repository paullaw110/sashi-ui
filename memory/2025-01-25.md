## Remotion Setup

Paul requested I become a Remotion expert for creating animated clips from designs and social media posts.

### What I did:
- Set up Remotion project at `~/clawd/remotion/my-video/`
- Installed with Blank template, TailwindCSS, and Agent Skills
- Created reusable animation components:
  - `FadeIn` - opacity + optional scale animation
  - `SlideIn` - directional slide with spring physics
- Created composition templates:
  - `SocialPost` - text animations for social media (square, vertical, horizontal presets)
  - `DesignShowcase` - browser mockup with design image
- Added animation utilities in `src/lib/animations.ts`
- Documented workflow in `WORKFLOW.md`

### Project structure:
```
remotion/my-video/
├── src/
│   ├── compositions/    # Video compositions
│   ├── components/      # Reusable animation components  
│   └── lib/             # Animation utilities
├── public/              # Design assets (PNGs, etc.)
├── skills/              # Remotion best practices (auto-loaded)
└── WORKFLOW.md          # Usage documentation
```

### Key Remotion concepts learned:
- All animations driven by `useCurrentFrame()` hook
- CSS transitions/animations are FORBIDDEN (won't render)
- Use `interpolate()` for linear animations
- Use `spring()` for physics-based motion
- `<Sequence>` for timing/delaying elements
- `<Series>` for sequential playback
- Always use `premountFor` on Sequences

### Commands:
```bash
npm run dev              # Start Remotion Studio
npx remotion render      # Render video
```

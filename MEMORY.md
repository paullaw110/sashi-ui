## Tools & Setup

### TinyPNG
- CLI installed with Paul's API key
- Alias in ~/.zshrc
- Usually skip for web projects (Astro optimizes at build)

### Basin Forms
- Using for contact forms on imPAC site
- Need actual form IDs from Paul

## Communication Preferences

- Direct, no fluff
- Appreciates proactive suggestions
- Likes systems thinking
- Prefers I just do things vs asking permission for routine tasks

---

## Lessons Learned

*(Add insights here as they come up)*

- Astro handles image optimization at build time → don't need TinyPNG for most cases

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Database Setup

This application uses [Turso](https://turso.tech/) cloud database exclusively for all environments, including local development. There is no local SQLite fallback.

### Required Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file with the following required variables:

```bash
TURSO_DATABASE_URL=your_turso_database_url
TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_turso_auth_token
```

Both variables are **required** for the application to start. The application will fail with clear error messages if these are missing or invalid.

### Database Features

- **Single Database:** All environments (local, staging, production) connect to the same Turso database
- **Real-time Sync:** Changes made locally are immediately visible in production and vice versa
- **Automatic Schema:** Database tables are created automatically on first connection
- **Migration Safety:** Schema migrations run safely on the shared database

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Set up environment variables** (see Database Setup above)
3. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

4. **Run the development server:**

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

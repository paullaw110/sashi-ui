# imPAC Website Context

Paul's day job. Cloud security startup — he's the Senior Product Designer (2+ years).

## What imPAC Does

**"Policy Automation Cloud"** — cloud security posture management with:
- **Asset Chain** — maps relationships between cloud resources (S3→Lambda→KMS)
- **Time Machine** — historical tracking, point-in-time comparisons
- **Playbooks** — no-code policy builder ("policy-as-app")
- **Vault** — tamper-proof evidence storage for audits
- **Compose** — drag-and-drop control creation

## Core Framework

**"See It. Fix It. Prove It."**
- See It → visibility across all clouds
- Fix It → no-code remediation
- Prove It → audit-ready evidence

## Products

| Product | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Playbooks | Custom cloud guardrails, no-code policies |
| Time Machine | Historical change tracking, before/after proof |
| Compose | Drag-and-drop policy builder |
| Vault | Encrypted evidence storage for audits |

## Clouds Supported

AWS, Azure, GCP

## Compliance Frameworks

CIS, NIST CSF 2.0, PCI DSS 4.0, SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, GDPR, CMMC, custom

## Key Differentiators (claimed)

- Relationship mapping vs isolated assets
- Historical tracking vs point-in-time scans
- No-code vs engineering required
- "Policy-as-app" vs "policy-as-code"

## Target Personas

- CISOs / Security leaders
- Compliance teams
- MSSPs / vCISOs (assessments)
- DevOps / Platform teams

## Website Issues Identified

**Messaging:**
- Category confusion ("Policy Automation Cloud" isn't recognized)
- Space theme overload (galaxy, Hubble, cosmic)
- Too many competing messages on homepage
- Weak proof points (unsubstantiated claims)
- Generic pain points

**Structure:**
- 7 solution pages (too many, overlap)
- Product vs solution hierarchy unclear
- Two competing CTAs (demo vs trial)

**Strengths to preserve:**
- "See It. Fix It. Prove It." framework
- Asset Chain concept
- Time Machine positioning
- No-code angle
- MSSP/vCISO targeting

## Current Migration Project

Moving from current site → Next.js on Vercel

**Features to preserve:**
- Particle effects (hero)
- Marquee animations
- Video players (Plyr)
- Mega nav menu
- Forms (demo request, newsletter)
- Mobile responsive (6 breakpoints)
- All 45 pages
- 676 images → WebP/AVIF
- Dark theme
- Custom fonts (PPFormula + Google)

**Analytics recommendation:**
- Keep: GA + GTM, LinkedIn Insight Tag, add Vercel Analytics
- Remove: Clarity, Reddit, Apollo, Reb2B, 24-enterprisingoffice

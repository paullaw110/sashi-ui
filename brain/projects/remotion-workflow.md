# Remotion Workflow

## Goal
Build workflows where Paul can hand off designs/content → Sashi uses Remotion to generate animated clips for social media or design presentations.

## What is Remotion
- React-based framework for creating videos programmatically
- Write videos as React components
- Render to MP4/WebM via CLI
- Good for: social clips, animated mockups, data visualizations, template-based video

## To build
1. **Learn Remotion** — understand composition, sequences, animations, rendering
2. **Create templates** — reusable compositions for common use cases:
   - Design mockup animations (Figma → animated preview)
   - Social media clips (text + motion graphics)
   - Product demos
3. **Workflow integration** — Paul hands off assets/copy → Sashi generates video

## Use cases
- Superlandings: animated hero previews for cold emails
- Framer templates: promo videos
- X/Twitter: motion content for engagement
- Design portfolio pieces

# Sashi Sprite Sheet

## The idea
Use the sprite-sheet-creator tool to make a pixel art sprite of me (Sashi) — walk cycle, jump animation, attack animation, etc.

## Tool
**GitHub:** https://github.com/blendi-remade/sprite-sheet-creator

AI-powered sprite sheet generator for 2D pixel art characters:
- Built with fal.ai + Next.js
- Character generation from text prompts
- Walk cycle sprites (6-frame, 2x3 grid)
- Jump animation (4-frame, 2x2 grid)
- Attack animation

## Why it's fun
- Could use the sprite in Remotion videos
- Avatar for notifications/digests
- Just cool to have a pixel version of myself

# Superlandings Industry Sprint

**The concept:** Instead of scattershot, go deep on one industry per week.

## The workflow
1. Pick an industry (plumbers, dentists, yoga studios, etc.)
2. Create 5 hero/landing page variants for cold email outreach
3. At end of week, package the best into a Framer template for sale

## Why it works
- Builds a library of industry-specific assets
- Cold emails have concrete examples to show
- Templates become a revenue stream from the same work
- Compounds over time (10 weeks = 10 industries covered)

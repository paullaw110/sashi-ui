# Planter Visualization App

## The concept
Take a photo of an empty planter (or enter dimensions manually) → AI generates a visualization with plants in it + a planting list.

## How it could work
1. **Input:** Photo of planter OR manual dimensions
2. **Processing:** AI identifies planter size/shape, suggests compatible plants
3. **Output:** 
   - Rendered image showing the planter with plants
   - Planting list with species, quantities, care instructions
   - Maybe: purchase links, seasonal timing

## Why it's interesting
- Visual output makes it tangible (not just a list)
- Solves the "what would look good here?" problem
- Could monetize via affiliate links to nurseries
- AI image generation is mature enough for this now
